# A simple stop motion app

For a workshop at Maker Space Heilbronn, I needed a simple Stop Motion App.
I found a lot of apps, but none of them was simple enough for my needs. So I decided to write my own app.

The app is written in vue and go. Server is for saving everything and giving me the ability to show everything after the workshop.
